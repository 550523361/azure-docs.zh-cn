# <a name="virtual-network-peering"></a>虚拟网络对等互连

Virtual network peering enables you to seamlessly connect networks in [Azure Virtual Network](virtual-networks-overview.md). The virtual networks appear as one for connectivity purposes. The traffic between virtual machines uses the Microsoft backbone infrastructure. Like traffic between virtual machines in the same network, traffic is routed through Microsoft's *private* network only.

Azure supports the following types of peering:

* Virtual network peering: Connect virtual networks within the same Azure region.
* Global virtual network peering: Connecting virtual networks across Azure regions.

使用虚拟网络对等互连（无论本地还是全局）的优点包括：

* 不同虚拟网络中资源之间的连接延迟低且带宽高。
* The ability for resources in one virtual network to communicate with resources in a different virtual network.
* The ability to transfer data between virtual networks across Azure subscriptions, Azure Active Directory tenants, deployment models, and Azure regions.
* The ability to peer virtual networks created through the Azure Resource Manager.
* The ability to peer a virtual network created through Resource Manager to one created through the classic deployment model. 若要详细了解 Azure 部署模型，请参阅[了解 Azure 部署模型](../azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-deployment-model.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json)。
* 在创建对等互连之时或之后，虚拟网络中的资源不会出现停机的现象。

对等虚拟网络之间的网络流量是专用的。 虚拟网络之间的流量仅限于 Microsoft 主干网络。 在虚拟网络之间通信不需公共 Internet、网关或加密。

## <a name="connectivity"></a>连接性

For peered virtual networks, resources in either virtual network can directly connect with resources in the peered virtual network.

同一区域中对等互连虚拟网络上的虚拟机之间的网络延迟与单个虚拟网络中的延迟相同。 网络吞吐量取决于可供虚拟机使用的与其大小成比例的带宽。 对等互连的带宽没有任何其他限制。

对等互连虚拟网络中虚拟机之间的流量直接通过 Microsoft 主干基础结构路由，而不通过网关或公共 Internet 路由。

You can apply network security groups in either virtual network to block access to other virtual networks or subnets.
When configuring virtual network peering, either open or close the network security group rules between the virtual networks. If you open full connectivity between peered virtual networks, you can apply network security groups to block or deny specific access. Full connectivity is the default option. To learn more about network security groups, see [Security groups](security-overview.md).

## <a name="service-chaining"></a>服务链

Service chaining enables you to direct traffic from one virtual network to a virtual appliance or gateway in a peered network through user-defined routes.

To enable service chaining, configure user-defined routes that point to virtual machines in peered virtual networks as the *next hop* IP address. User-defined routes could also point to virtual network gateways to enable service chaining.

You can deploy hub-and-spoke networks, where the hub virtual network hosts infrastructure components such as a network virtual appliance or VPN gateway. 然后，可以将所有分散虚拟网络与中心虚拟网络对等。 Traffic flows through network virtual appliances or VPN gateways in the hub virtual network.

通过虚拟网络对等互连，用户定义的路由中的下一个跃点可以成为对等虚拟网络中虚拟机或 VNP 网关的 IP 地址。 You can't route between virtual networks with a user-defined route that specifies an Azure ExpressRoute gateway as the next hop type. 若要深入了解用户定义的路由，请参阅[用户定义的路由概述](virtual-networks-udr-overview.md#user-defined)。 To learn how to create a hub and spoke network topology, see [Hub-spoke network topology in Azure](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/hub-spoke?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json).

## <a name="gateways-and-on-premises-connectivity"></a>网关和本地连接

Each virtual network, including a peered virtual network, can have its own gateway. A virtual network can use its gateway to connect to an on-premises network. You can also configure [virtual network-to-virtual network connections](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-vnet-vnet-rm-ps.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) by using gateways, even for peered virtual networks.

When you configure both options for virtual network interconnectivity, the traffic between the virtual networks flows through the peering configuration. The traffic uses the Azure backbone.

You can also configure the gateway in the peered virtual network as a transit point to an on-premises network. In this case, the virtual network that is using a remote gateway can't have its own gateway. A virtual network has only one gateway. The gateway is either a local or remote gateway in the peered virtual network, as shown in the following diagram:

![虚拟网络对等互连传输](./media/virtual-networks-peering-overview/local-or-remote-gateway-in-peered-virual-network.png)

Both virtual network peering and global virtual network peering support gateway transit.

Gateway transit between virtual networks created through different deployment models is supported. The gateway must be in the virtual network in the Resource Manager model. 若要了解有关使用网关进行传输的详细信息，请参阅[配置 VPN 网关以在虚拟网络对等互连中传输](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-peering-gateway-transit.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json)。

When you peer virtual networks that share a single Azure ExpressRoute connection, the traffic between them goes through the peering relationship. That traffic uses the Azure backbone network. 仍可在各个虚拟网络中使用本地网关连接到本地线路。 Otherwise, you can use a shared gateway and configure transit for on-premises connectivity.

## <a name="troubleshoot"></a>故障排除

To confirm that virtual networks are peered, you can check effective routes. Check routes for a network interface in any subnet in a virtual network. 如果虚拟网络对等互连存在，则虚拟网络中的所有子网都会有下一跃点类型为“VNet 对等互连”的路由，这适用于每个对等互连的虚拟网络中的每个地址空间。 For more information, see [Diagnose a virtual machine routing problem](diagnose-network-routing-problem.md).

You can also troubleshoot connectivity to a virtual machine in a peered virtual network using Azure Network Watcher. A connectivity check lets you see how traffic is routed from a source virtual machine's network interface to a destination virtual machine's network interface. For more information, see [Troubleshoot connections with Azure Network Watcher using the Azure portal](../network-watcher/network-watcher-connectivity-portal.md#check-connectivity-to-a-virtual-machine).

You can also try the [Troubleshoot virtual network peering issues](virtual-network-troubleshoot-peering-issues.md).

## Constraints for peered virtual networks<a name="requirements-and-constraints"></a>

仅当虚拟网络全局对等互连时，以下约束适用：

* Resources in one virtual network can't communicate with the front-end IP address of a Basic Internal Load Balancer (ILB)  in a globally peered virtual network.
* Some services that use a Basic load balancer don't work over global virtual network peering. For more information, see [What are the constraints related to Global VNet Peering and Load Balancers?](virtual-networks-faq.md#what-are-the-constraints-related-to-global-vnet-peering-and-load-balancers).

For more information, see [Requirements and constraints](virtual-network-manage-peering.md#requirements-and-constraints). To learn more about the supported number of peerings, see [Networking limits](../azure-subscription-service-limits.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#azure-resource-manager-virtual-networking-limits).

## <a name="permissions"></a>权限

To learn about permissions required to create a virtual network peering, see [Permissions](virtual-network-manage-peering.md#permissions).

## <a name="pricing"></a>价格

There's a nominal charge for ingress and egress traffic that uses a virtual network peering connection. For more information, see [Virtual Network pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-network).

Gateway Transit is a peering property that enables a virtual network to utilize a VPN/ExpressRoute gateway in a peered virtual network. Gateway transit works for both cross premises and network-to-network connectivity. Traffic to the gateway (ingress or egress) in the peered virtual network incurs virtual network peering charges. For more information, see [VPN Gateway pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/vpn-gateway/) for VPN gateway charges and ExpressRoute Gateway pricing for ExpressRoute gateway charges.

>[!NOTE]
> A previous version of this document stated that virtual network peering charges would not apply with Gateway Transit. It now reflects accurate pricing per the pricing page.
